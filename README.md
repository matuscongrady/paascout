## What is [PaaScout.io](http://PaaScount.io)?

---

PaaS platforms make it easy to manage infrastructure and deploy applications. Developers can handle app deployment independently, without needing to learn DevOps.

With so many Platform as a Service providers in the market, it’s not easy to know where to start. We created a guide to compare modern PaaS providers using over 40 criteria, so you can make smart choices about your infrastructure.

## Who is behind [PaaScout.io](http://PaaScount.io)?

---

The founder of [**Stacktape](https://stacktape.com/)** maintains this project.

The project is open source, allowing anyone to contribute. We allow new providers or features as long as they benefit at least a small group of PaaS users. Everyone welcome!
